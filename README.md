This is Friday, an app for your friday's nights!

Friday is a project made for Mega Hack 3.0, a Hackathon promoted by Shawee.
The ideia behind the project (a challenge made by AMBEV) is to increase Brazilian Bar attendance, speccialy among youngsters.
The solution built is a Native App that can be used to find bars around the city, so that it can be easier to choose where to go.
It can also be used to order anything from the Menu and to pay for everything you consume in the night, facilitating all ordering and payment burocracy.
At last, the user can avaliate the bar service, space, food quality, drinks quality, cleaning, price and leave a comment.
In the plataform, users can look every registered bar menu, pictures, adress, business hours, telephone number, avaliation and comments, as well as check-in in the bar (scanning the table QR Code in the bar) and use the ordering system (and intra app payment, at the end)
Also, there is a plataform to search for events and promotions registered by the bars

PS: the user has to create an account to use the App Features

PS2: Registering the credit card is optional and the user can elect to pay in cash to check-out

This repository contains the React Native Project for the user experience
The API to which this project is liked can be found in https://github.com/jvdprates/backend-megahack60

The bar administration section has not been started yet, but the team is beggining to plan it. For now, it is expected to be a web system.
